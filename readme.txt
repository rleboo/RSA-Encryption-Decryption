This project allows the encyption and decryption of inputed text using RSA. 'make all' will compile everything. Alternatively you can compile several individual pieces by following the steps below.

--keygen--
To compile: make keygen
To run: ./keygen <primeNumber> <primeNumber> public.txt private.txt
Description:
Keygen uses the prime numbers (when multiplied together must have a product > 256) to create the public and private keys neccessary of RSA encryption/decryption. These keys are printed out to public.txt (for the public key) and private.txt (for the private keys)

--encrypt--
To compile: make encrypt
To run: ./encrypt public.txt plaintext.txt encrypted.txt
Description:
Encrypt reads the public keys(from public.txt) generated by keygen to encrypt each character in the given plaintext(message to be encypted). 


--decrypt--
To compile: make decrypt
To run: ./decrypt private.txt enrypted.txt decrypted.txt
Description:
Decrypt reads the private keys(from private.txt) generated by keygen to decrypt each number from the encrypted file.
